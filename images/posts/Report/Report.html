as mead. &nbsp;Mead is made by fermenting honey with water. &nbsp;Mead is oftentimes flavored with fruits and spices but it&#39;s generally higher in alcohol than beer and is much more similar to wine. &nbsp;Additionally mead is produced in a variety of sweetness levels and can be still or sparkling. &nbsp;We will specifically cover the process we used, techniques that we discovered, mistakes that we made and advice for other homebrewers. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0 c4 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4 c7"><span

began our adventure in homebrewing by first doing research on the materials that were required. &nbsp;Our initial searches led us to simply buying a kit that is used for most small homebrew setups. &nbsp;This kit consisted of a 1.5 gallon fermentation bucket, a 1 gallon carboy, a beer thief (pump and tube for moving the mead between containers), a three piece airlock, campton tables, and yeast nutrient. &nbsp;For $10 more we added a thermometer but opted out of the large spoon that would fit in the carboy. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><img></p><p class="c10"><span class="c11 c6">Figure 1: Materials</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These materials were not a horrible combination since you can successfully brew with these items but it is key to know exactly what materials you need and what they are used for. &nbsp;The large spoon appeared to be much more useful than anticipated, having a hydrometer to take the initial and final gravity is almost essential, and having a vessel to take the gravity check in is also important. &nbsp;After acquiring the initial kit we set out to find what honey would be have the best value in our area. &nbsp;This is key as the type of honey you use largely dictates the notes your mead will emit once fermented. &nbsp;We chose to use mesquite honey which can be purchased in large quantities from Trader Joes. &nbsp;After some conversation with other mazers we have decided that it might be a better idea to purchase honey from local apiaries at nearby farmer markets but this is purely a personal preference. &nbsp;Finally we sought the perfect yeast to produce the type of mead that we desired and what would work best in our small operation. &nbsp;We chose to use Lelvin 71b-1122 which is &ldquo;a rapid starting and constant fermenting semi-dry white wine yeast that will enhance fruit flavors and add fruity esters&rdquo;. (Lelvin) &nbsp;Typically this yeast is used in melomels, or fruit meads, as it flourishes at handling the fermentation of fruit. &nbsp;It also has an alcohol tolerance of 14% although we did not reach this in our first attempt. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">Our process for making the mead was standard among mazers/methiers, 3 pounds of honey for every gallon of water. &nbsp;After watching some videos other homebrewers have posted we chose to use the glass carboy as our primary fermenter. &nbsp;This was suboptimal as we did not take in consideration that we could not fit 3 pounds of honey and 1 gallon of water in a 1 gallon container. &nbsp;This resulted in an incredibly sweet concoction which the yeast could not fully ferment. &nbsp;In future endeavours we chose to instead use the over sized fermentation bucket which allowed for the proper amount of space for the ingredients. &nbsp;It is also important to note that Rochester tap water has a large amount of chlorine which is not optimal for the must. &nbsp;So we purchased a large tank of mineral water to counter this problem. &nbsp;Next we ensured that everything is sanitized thoroughly which is arguably the most important practice to use when brewing anything. &nbsp;We chose to use a diluted bleach solution however this has a lot of downsides such as chlorine getting into the must and off flavors being produced. &nbsp;In future endeavours we chose to use StarSan as it is an effective cleaning solution that can be air dried. &nbsp;It will also turn into food for the yeast after a certain period of time promoting a stronger fermentation. &nbsp;The process for filling the carboy consisted of draining the honey into the carboy and then mixing water to fill the vessel.</span></p><p class="c0 c4 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><img></p><p class="c10"><span class="c11 c6">Figure 2: Adding Water to the Honey</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next we began hydrating the yeast which some brewers believe to be essential while others note that they are too lazy to use this practice. &nbsp;After some research we saw a trend that suggested that hydrating the yeast will encourage a much stronger fermentation and prove to be more effective however we did not test this ourselves. &nbsp;This process consisted of boiling some of the mineral water and putting it into a sanitized container while allowing it to cool to the ideal starting temperature for the yeast (104-109 degrees fahrenheit). &nbsp;Once this temperature was reached we dumped the packet of yeast into the water and immediately stirred it resulting in a very explosive production of foam. &nbsp;This was also suboptimal and the correct technique is to slowly sift the yeast onto the water using a spoon. &nbsp;After waiting about 15 minutes you may stir the yeast and pitch it into the must. &nbsp;It is important to note that the temperature of the hydrated yeast and the must should be within 10 degrees fahrenheit of each other. &nbsp;If they are not, you run into the problem of shocking the yeast and causing a poor fermentation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden;

shaped airlock and some new yeast since our initial intuition was that we over sanitized and killed our yeast. &nbsp;This turned out to be incorrect as we learned that the yeast requires initial aeration to properly ferment. &nbsp;We chose to then violently stir the carboy with the thermometer as well as rotating the mead in the carboy. &nbsp;Then we applied the airlock and let it sit where after a few hours we discovered that we were producing bubbles in the airlock. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden;
